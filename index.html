          <div class="back hidden">
            <p>A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object is mostly made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods.</p>

            <p>In programming, a value that is passed between programs, subroutines or functions. Arguments are independent items, or variables, that contain data or codes. When an argument is used to customize a program for a user, it is typically called a "parameter."</p>

            <p>A parameter is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine. These pieces of data are called arguments.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="back hidden">
            <p>Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.</p>

            <p>A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation).</p>

            <p>The Boolean data type is a data type, having two values (usually denoted true and false), intended to represent the truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. It is named after George Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century.</p>

            <p>Undefined value is a condition where an expression does not have a correct value, although it is syntactically correct. An undefined value must not be confused with empty string, boolean "false" or other "empty" (but defined) values.</p>

            <p>But escape characters used in programming (such as the backslash, "\") are graphic, hence are not control characters. ... In many programming languages, an escape character also forms some escape sequences which are referred to control characters. For example, line break has an escape sequence of \n .</p>
